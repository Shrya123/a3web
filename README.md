Assignment 3 – Web Design and Programming 

Webpage Decision 

    Create a more elaborate website as a GIS consulting group  

    JABRS Mapping Consultants provide many geospatial services for our valued clients. Our main services are map creation, web/internet mapping, cartography and cartography modeling, urban planning & design, and topological modeling. 

IDEAS FOR WEBSITE: 

    JABRS Mapping Consultants

    GIS consultant firm - GIS mapping companies, gather, organize, and analyze spatial and non-spatial data of a particular geographic location and present them in the form of dynamic maps. 

    We are going to add photos from some of our other courses to highlight our work and what our consulting group does  

    The photos will also help the flow of the website because often time too much text is hard to understand so the pictures will help break up wordy areas 

    The website will be easy to understand with good color composition that will drive the user to want to be on our webpage 

    The user interface is also extremely important to us so we will make sure that the website is readily accessible and easy to follow no matter the device the user is viewing it on 

    The website with showcase projects that we have worked on and what their outcome was. This will help to give the customer a good understanding of what we do here at JABRS Consulting Ltd  

Group Distribution 

Group Decisions  

Color Scheme and Photo layout These decisions are more designed/ accessibility based, so we decided that it would be better if we made these choices as a group. These will help to create a nice and organized layout for our  customers when they are viewing the site. Each member of the group will put in equal effort for this part because it is a major part of creating a unique and workable webpage These will be done by week 12 because it is an important part of the beginning of the webpage process

    specific area of improvement would be the Settings.html and Template.html tab 

    Be able to have it organized to easily allow the potential client to understand which services are available 

    The template.html will demonstrate our overall design  

    She can be done this section of the webpage by the end of week 13 to allow her ample time to perfect the HTML and CSS components to display an aesthetic, functional website. 

Breanne  

    HTML in Index.html: our “Index” tab will allow customers to get an understanding of what our goal is and how we can help them. 

    About.html “about” tab will allow our customers to learn more about us and our backgrounds in consulting. 

    Specific area of improvement would be found in the index.html and about.html tabs  

    These can be done by the beginning of week 13 and the middle for week 13 respectively which will ensure that the HTML and CSS components display a functional and aesthetic website. 

Jing 

    Navigation bar for all pages, to be done by the end of week 12

    HTML in About.html. work on the “about” tab to outline why we decided to start this company and other interesting facts about us.

Adineh  

    CSS file Photos of projects, email link Adineh is working on adding CSS to our website to allow our creative design ideas to be successfully demonstrated throughout our website. Adineh has added maps to our portfolio to show the talent of our employees to our potential clients visiting our webpage. This will work as an insight into the work that can create.
